# LaTeX snippets

This configuration is inspired by [Obsidian Latex Suite](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite),
which is based on the [Gilles Castel's setup using UltiSnips](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/).
LuaSnip for LaTeX is configured according to the information provided on ["A LuaSnip guide for LaTeX workflows"](https://ejmastnak.com/tutorials/vim-latex/luasnip/), which is a well-written beginner-friendly guide to build environment for LaTeX on NeoVim.
Snippets for fraction is based on implementation in [evesdropper/luasnip-latex-snippets.nvim](https://github.com/evesdropper/luasnip-latex-snippets.nvim).
